# ODSC London - D3 workshop

- make sure you have Python installed on your local system https://www.python.org/
- get the files:
  - if you know git, clone this repo
  - otherwise download the zipfile and unzip the file
- open a command line window
- cd into the unzipped folder
- run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer &`
- open a browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`
- open the developer console via the menu. You should see the message: "yes, it's working"

We will be editing code, so for your own convenience, please use a code editor, for example: [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or any other editor you prefer.

This is the starting point for the workshop. The final file, which has all comments describing what we've done, will be shared with you via this repository as well, once the workshop is over.
